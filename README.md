Rideshare app 

Hello World!

I am a California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo student who wants to create a communal ride share application specifically for incoming freshman to travel to the grocery store whenever they need to, because of the ban on cars starting in the 2017-2018 school year. This allows freshman to meet upperclassman, and allows upperclassman to help freshmen get accustomed to campus, while making money. This edit is a description of what the application accomplishes.
